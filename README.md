# Week-8-Weather-API-Dashboard


## Description 

This project is to develop and produce a weather dashboard to provide weather data for any requested city the user searches for and to give the option for the user to see the next five days of weather for said location.

The search history for the user will be retained until such time as the user clears it to all a user who is traveling to check the weather data for several locations without needing to search for the cities each time.
The following criteria are required to be met for the project to be viewed as completed:

* A weather dashboard with form inputs.
    * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the   search history
    * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The Pressure
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
    * When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The Pressure
    * The humidity
    * The Wind Speed
    * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Usage 

To use the website the user will need to go to the deployed application, a link for which can be found under the [Links](#links) section of the readme file.

Once the user views the website they can add their city that they require into the input box labeled 'enter a city' they then click on the 'search cities' button. 

A box to the right of the page will display the current data for the entered city if it exists and a box underneath will be populated with the five day forecast for that city going forward. Simultaneously a button will appear in the search history for the requested city.

If the user wishes to clear their search history they can do so by clicking 'clear search history'
