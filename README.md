# Week-8-Weather-API-Dashboard


## Description 

This project is to develop and produce a weather dashboard to provide weather data for any requested city the user searches for and to give the option for the user to see the next five days of weather for said location.

The search history for the user will be retained until such time as the user clears it to all a user who is traveling to check the weather data for several locations without needing to search for the cities each time.
The following criteria are required to be met for the project to be viewed as completed:

* A weather dashboard with form inputs.
* When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
* When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
* When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
